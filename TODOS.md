# Contextify TODOs

This document tracks feature ideas, enhancements, and known issues for future development.

## Active Development

### P0 - In Progress
- Transcript inventory with worktree support (feature/transcript-inventory)
- Line number tracking for narrative composition

### P1 - Next Up
- Session switching from transcript inventory UI
- Narrative composition from selected timeline entries

## Backlog

### Features

#### Conversation Log Enhancements

##### 1. Avoid Sequential Completed Entries
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** Medium

The conversation log currently can show multiple sequential "completed" entries, which creates redundancy and clutters the timeline.

**Example of redundancy:**
```
✓ Claude marks the final todo as completed.

Perfect! The build succeeded with no errors. Let me mark the final todo as completed.

✓ Claude successfully converted the Transcript Inventory to an independent window...

## Implementation Complete!
I've successfully converted the Transcript Inventory from a modal sheet to an independent window...
```

**Proposed Solution:**
When processing timeline entries marked as "completed":
1. Check if the previous entry is also marked as "completed"
2. If so, merge or suppress the second completion entry
3. Consider consolidating the summaries or only showing the more detailed one
4. Possibly use a different indicator (e.g., "Progress: ..." vs "✓ Completed")

**Implementation considerations:**
- May need to distinguish between "task completed" vs "subtask completed"
- Could use confidence scoring on completion detection
- Should preserve important context even when merging

##### 2. Task Duration Tracking
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** Medium
**Depends on:** Enhancement #1 (completed entry detection)

Once we can reliably identify completed entries, show the elapsed time from the user's request to completion.

**Proposed UI:**
- Show duration next to completed entries (e.g., "✓ Completed in 2m 34s")
- Add small arrow icon (↑) next to completed entries
- Clicking arrow scrolls to and highlights the original request in the log
- Hovering shows timestamp of request and completion

**Implementation considerations:**
- Need to track correlation between user requests and completion events
- Store request UUID with each task
- Calculate duration from first relevant assistant message to completion marker
- Handle cases where tasks span multiple timeline entries

#### Transcript Migration UI (Low Priority)
**Status:** Backlog
**Related:** `scripts/migrate-transcripts.sh`

When users move their project to a new directory (e.g., `~/code/contextify` → `~/code/projects/contextify`), Claude Code creates a new transcript directory. Old transcripts remain at the old location with outdated paths in content.

**Current Solution:**
Manual script at `scripts/migrate-transcripts.sh` that:
- Backs up old transcripts
- Copies to new location
- Rewrites all path references to new location

**Future Enhancement:**
Wrap the script in UI:
- Detect when project path has changed
- Offer to migrate old transcripts
- Show preview of what will be migrated
- One-click migration with progress indicator
- Automatic backup before migration

**Priority:** Low (manual script works fine, edge case)
